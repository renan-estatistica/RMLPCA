Description: R implementation of Maximum Likelihood Principal Component Analysis
    proposed in Wentzell, Peter D., et al. "Maximum likelihood principal 
    component analysis." Journal of Chemometrics: A Journal of the Chemometrics
    Society 11.4 (1997): 339-366. 
    The main idea of this package is to have an alternative way of PCA for 
    dimensionality reduction that considers measurement errors.
