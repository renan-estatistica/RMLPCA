#' Errors generated for mlpca_c model
#'
#' A dataset where each column contain values from a normal density with mean
#' = 0 and standard deviations simulated by a lognormal density with
#' meanlog = -4.75 and sdlog = 2.5, all the standard deviations are different.
#' The main ideia is described in figure 3 on Wentzell, P. D.
#' "Other topics in soft-modeling: maximum likelihood-based soft-modeling
#' methods." (2009): 507-558.
